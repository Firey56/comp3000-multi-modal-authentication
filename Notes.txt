Things to maybe do:


Facial Recognition:
	Use AWS face liveness to mitigate risks of a photo being used
		This can also be used if a user pastes in the password rather than typing it as bypasses the machine learning.
	


Logging in:
	Use stored procedure to check the username and password is the correct and returns a flag variable.
		Mitigate risk of variables being leaked.
	
	Ensure data sanitisation to prevent SQL injection.


Photo Taking:
	Have timer that triggers when state changes in username and password text boxes.
	Trigger every 0.5s to take a photo, send off for face comparison. //Half complete
		Have this trigger based on time rather than time elapsed when they enter a character.

Sign up:
	User can either take a live photo or upload a photo (?)
	Require user to type their password in X amount of times so there is some sample data for the machine learning?



Give multiple confidence scores - return confidence score based off the different combinations.
		Different access control.

Use of feature vectors instead of storing b64 image.
